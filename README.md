**DAY-1 (Basic programs)**

1. Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and displays the product of two numbers.
2. Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a circle.
3. Write a Java program that reads a number in inches and converts it to meters.
4. Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number.
5. Write a Java program that takes a year from the user and prints whether that year is a leap year.
6. Write a Java program to swap two numbers.
7. Write a Java program to grade students based on their marks.

**DAY-2**

1. Print the pattern.
2. Write a Java program to find the numbers greater than the average of the numbers of a given array.
3. write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table.
4. write a Java program to sum the values of an array.
5. write a Java program to find an array's maximum and minimum number.
6. write a Java program to separate zeros on the left side and once on the right side of an array of zeros and ones in random order.
7. write a Java method to find the smallest number among three numbers.

**DAY-3**
1. Write a program for Default Access Modifier.
2. Write a Java program for Fibonacci Series.
3. write a Java program to find a factorial for the given number.

**DAY-4**

*TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY*
1. Big O notation (O) represents the upper bound or the worst-case scenario of the algorithm's time or space complexity. It denotes the maximum growth rate of the algorithm as the input size increases.

2. Omega notation (Ω) represents the lower bound or the best-case scenario of the algorithm's time or space complexity. It denotes the minimum growth rate of the algorithm as the input size increases.

3. Theta notation (Θ) represents the tight bound or the average-case scenario of the algorithm's time or space complexity. It denotes both the upper and lower bounds, indicating that the algorithm's growth rate is bounded within these limits.
